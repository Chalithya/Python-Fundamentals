# Python Data Structures

## Overview

This module covers three essential data structures in Python: Dictionaries, Tuples, and Sets. These data structures provide powerful ways to organize, store, and retrieve data efficiently.

## Topics Covered

1. **[Dictionaries](01-dictionary/)** - Key-value pairs for mapping relationships
2. **[Tuples](02-tuples/)** - Immutable sequences of elements
3. **[Sets](03-sets/)** - Unordered collections of unique elements

## Learning Path

These data structures build upon your knowledge of basic Python types and lists. Understanding these structures is essential for:

- Efficiently organizing and accessing data
- Representing complex relationships
- Improving code performance
- Building more advanced data structures

## When to Use Which Data Structure

| Data Structure | When to Use | Key Characteristics |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Dictionary** | Mapping relationships, fast lookups by key | Mutable, key-value pairs, keys must be hashable |
| **Tuple** | Fixed collections, multi-value returns, dictionary keys | Immutable, ordered, can contain different data types |
| **Set** | Eliminating duplicates, membership testing, mathematical set operations | Mutable, unordered, unique elements, elements must be hashable |

## Best Practices

- Choose the appropriate data structure based on your specific requirements
- Consider performance implications for large datasets
- Use comprehensions for concise creation of data structures
- Leverage built-in methods specific to each data structure

## Further Learning

After mastering these data structures, you'll be prepared to learn more about:

- Advanced data structures like defaultdict, Counter, and OrderedDict
- Data organization patterns in Python
- Object-oriented programming in Python
- Functional programming concepts
